# Git Push Instructions

## ✅ Local Repository Created!

Your code has been committed locally. To push to a remote repository, follow these steps:

## Option 1: Push to GitHub (Recommended)

### Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository
1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `sumo-emergency-vehicle-priority` (or your preferred name)
3. Description: "SUMO simulation for emergency vehicle priority at traffic intersections"
4. Choose: Public or Private
5. **Don't** initialize with README (we already have one)
6. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Add Remote and Push
After creating the repository, run these commands:

```powershell
# Add the remote repository (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/sumo-emergency-vehicle-priority.git

# Rename branch to main (GitHub's default)
git branch -M main

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Authenticate
- You'll be prompted to login to GitHub
- Use your GitHub credentials or Personal Access Token

## Option 2: Push to Existing Repository

If you already have a repository URL:

```powershell
# Add remote (replace URL with your repository URL)
git remote add origin YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL

# Push
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```
